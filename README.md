# SC-IoMT-Auth

This is a work in progress

The three Smart Contracts presented here are written in Solidity. 
They are part of a fine-grain authorization mechanism based on a private Ethereum Blockchain for managing Internet of Medical Things 
devices that involve several users (Patients, Doctors, Hospital's Medical personnel, Manufacturer).

The Registration SC is for registering users and medical devices into the Blockchain (we use a certificate based authentication scheme)

The Actor Handling SC is for implementing basic functionalities with restrictions based on the role and the location

The Logging SC is for storing the Logs of every action made by the users and link them with their id's accordingly

The code is well commented
